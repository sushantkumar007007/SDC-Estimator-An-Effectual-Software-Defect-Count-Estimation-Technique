# SDC-Estimator-An-Effectual-Software-Defect-Count-Estimation-Technique

Estimating the number of defects in a software project before the testing phase can reduce the enormous amount of development cost and help in allocating testing resources optimally and efficiently. But estimating the number of defects in each module of a successive version of the software system will be more efficient in minimizing the development cost.  This is s prediction model to predict number of bugs in the new software system. We utilized Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) along with Attention layer architecture in our proposed model.

We used seven software projects and their existing versions from the PROMISE repository.
This repository consists of all the source code along with results. 
Following are the requiremnts. 
Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.pyplot, Sklearn.preprocessing, StandardScaler
Scipy
Sklearn
Imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
Time 
Keras
We have also shared the time distributed Attention architecture. 

**System requiremnets: Windos/Mac or clode service, CPU/GPU, RAM more than 8GB, **
